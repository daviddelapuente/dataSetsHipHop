       "\"You can't, you won't and you don't stop. Mike d come on and rock the sure shot. I've got the brand new doo-doo guaranteed. Like yoo hoo. I'm on like dr john, yea mr zu zu. I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee. And everything I do is funky like lee dorsey. Well, it's the taking fo pelham, one, two, three. If you want a doodoo rhyme then come see me. I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhyme. And. I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and. Strictly hand held is the style I go. Never rock the mic with the panty hose. I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go. 'couse at the boards is the man they call the. Mario. Pull up at the function and you know I kojak. To all the party people that are on my bozak. I've got more action than my man john woo. And I've got mad hits like I was rod crew. You can't, you won't and you don't stop. Ad rock come and rock the sure shot. Hurricane will cross fade on your ass and. Bust your ear drums. Listen everybody 'couse I'm shifting gears I'm. Fresh like dougie when I set my specs and. On the microphone I come correct. Timing like a clock when I'rock the hip hop. Top notch is my stock on the soap box. I've got more rhymes than I'v got grey hairs. And that's alot because I've got my share. I've got a hole in my head and there's no one. To fix it. Got to straighten my thoughts, I'm thinking too. Much sick shit. Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes,. Takes. I've got to step back, I've got to contemplate. I'm like lee perry, I'm very. On rock the microphone and then I'm gone. I'm like vaughn bode, I'm a cheech wizard. Never quitting, so won't you listen. Oh yes indeed, it's fun time. 'cause you can't, you won't and you don't stop. Mca come and rock the sure shot. I want to say a little something that's long. Overdue. The disrespect to women has got to be through. To all the mothers and sisters a and ahe. Wives and friends. I want to offer my love and respect to the. End. Well you say I'm twenty something and should. Be slacking. But I'm working harder than ever and you could. Call it macking. So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch watching my. T.v.. I'm still iistening to wax, I'm not using the cd. I'm that kid in the corner. All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna. Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quitting. Think I'm gonna change up my style just to fit in. I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic. I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic. To send my rhymes out to all nations. Like ma bell, I've got the ill communications. . (chorus)\""
